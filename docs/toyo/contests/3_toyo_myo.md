# TOYO MYO Challenge

*thatmatt* [made an awesome rendition](https://discordapp.com/channels/1295352148846055444/1313160005553488026/1347281985571131395) of the TOYO logo into a card design and I love it. I'd really love to be able to print it on the BACK of some blank MYO cards, leaving the front open for whatever normal customization, printing, stickers, etc that would normally happen. I have a plan for how I want to use this design for community supporters.

## Mission
Make a TOYO card design that perfectly overlaps the standard *English MYO* card text and images, such that when printed with black ink the Yoto labeling disappears.

This is a special **Bounty Challenge**. *This challenge will stay open until it is claimed.*

Notes:
* *black ink is desired because its 10% the cost of color ink and covers the green a lot better without distortion.*
* Due to print variance, a 0.5 or 1mm margin of error surrounding all the underlying components is advised.

## Submissions
* Submit your final image to ⁠[#⁠contact-toyo](https://discordapp.com/channels/1295352148846055444/1297387976266874991) via art ticket.
* Along with the submission, please label as Original artwork, AI assisted, or AI generated

**By submitting artwork to this contest, you grant a perpetual use license to this TOYO community, the organizers, and its members.**

## Bounty Prize Pool
It's not much, but I can offer...
* 500,000 coins
* 2,500 XP
* 20 yak points
* The first successful printing of this card image from my ID printer
