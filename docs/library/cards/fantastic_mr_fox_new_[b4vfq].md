| Title | Fantastic Mr Fox NEW |
| Author | Roald Dahl |

**Description**:

Brought to you by Penguin.    

Fantastic Mr Fox is narrated by multi-award winning actor Adrian Lester (Hustle, The Day After Tomorrow), and is bursting with fantabulous sound effects.    

"On a hill above the valley there was a wood.   In the wood there was a huge tree. Under the tree there was a hole.   In the hole lived Mr Fox and Mrs Fox and their four Small Foxes. . . "    

Mr Fox is a very clever fox - every evening he creeps down into the valley and helps himself to food from the nearby farms. Chickens from Farmer Boggis, ducks and geese from Farmer Bunce, and turkeys from Farmer Bean. But now the farmers have had enough, and together they hatch a plan to get rid of Mr Fox for good! But what they don't know is Mr Fox has some help, and a fantastic escape plan of his own... 

The text in this edition of Fantastic Mr Fox was updated in 2022 for young independent readers.
