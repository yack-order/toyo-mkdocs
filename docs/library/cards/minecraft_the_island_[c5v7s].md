| Title | Minecraft: The Island |
| Author | Max Brooks |

**Description**:

_**Yoto says:** The first official Minecraft novel! Explore forests, loot tunnels and defeat undead mobs in a mysterious new world._

Washed up on a beach, the lone castaway looks around the shore. Where am I? Who am I? And why is everything made of blocks? But there isn't much time to soak up the sun. It's getting dark, and there's a strange new world to explore!  
  
The top priority is finding food. The next is not becoming food. Because there are others out there on the island...like the horde of zombies that appear after night falls. Crafting a way out of this mess is a challenge like no other. Who could build a home while running from exploding creepers, armed skeletons, and an unstoppable tide of hot lava? Especially with no help except for a few makeshift tools and sage advice from an unlikely friend: a cow.  
  
In this world, the rules don't always make sense, but courage and creativity go a long way. There are forests to explore, hidden underground tunnels to loot, and undead mobs to defeat. Only then will the secrets of the island be revealed.
