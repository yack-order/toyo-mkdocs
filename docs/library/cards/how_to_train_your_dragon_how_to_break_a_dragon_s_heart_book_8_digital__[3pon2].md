| Title | How to Train Your Dragon: How to Break a Dragon's Heart: Book 8 (Digital) |
| Author | Cressida Cowell |

**Description**:

The eight volume in the hilarious series which inspired the Dream Works film, How To Train Your Dragon.  

Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III was an awesome sword-fighter, a dragon-whisperer, and the greatest viking hero who ever lived. But it wasn't always like that. Hiccup's memoirs look back to when Hiccup was just an ordinary boy, and finding it very hard to be a hero. Hiccup must battle Berserks, dodge Scarers, complete the Impossible Task and save Fishlegs from being fed to the Beast! And all while being hunted down by an old enemy with a dark secret about the Lost Throne. What's a hero to do?
