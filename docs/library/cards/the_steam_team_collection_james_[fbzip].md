| Author | Thomas & Friends™ |

**Description**:

Meet James! He’s very proud of his new shiny red paintwork, and believes it makes him the smartest, funniest and most useful engine on the railway. But when James plays a trick on Gordon, he soon learns that not all jokes are funny.

Complete with a brand new interactive engine quiz, join James on three fun-filled adventures on the Island of Sodor specially selected from the Thomas & Friends ™ Storytime Podcast!
