At Home with Martin & Sylvia: The Special Magical Day: There are days that are special because they are holidays or birthdays or celebrations of important events. And then, once in a while, there are special days just because they are special. One morning Martin wakes with the singular thought that it is going to be a Special Magical day. And so he and his sister spend the rest of the day discovering the magic around every corner.

Junkyard Tales: The Flowers: Flowers are popping up all around the Junkyard. When Ben Thompson asks where they are coming from, Lil’Mamma, the busy rabbit, shrugs her shoulders and says “Magic, I guess.” With the help of Mizzie Niegel, the wise mouse from the far side of Junkyard, Ben learns the source of the magic and in the process finds a new friend.

So Many Fairies: The Magic Birthday Candles: Sarah Jane's friends love all her fancy toys and her big playroom, but she would rather play "Hide-and-Seek" or "Explorers", or tag — and not cars or dolls. On her sixth birthday, surrounded by her friends, she makes a birthday wish that inspires a certain fire fairy to create some unique birthday magic for the whole party.
