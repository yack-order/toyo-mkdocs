**Description**:

Yoto says: Embark on a musical journey through the diverse landscapes of South Africa, where the sounds of the vuvuzela and the rhythms of the mbaqanga will transport you to a world of rhythm and harmony.

Few countries can rival South Africa's rich range of musical styles. Here we give you a taste of this vibrant country's musical melting pot. From the acapella, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, a group made famous by Paul Simon’s Graceland album, to the gritty raw township style of Mahlathini & The Mahotella Queens. Elsewhere, Teaspoon the saxophonist serves up a singalong party anthem and Sipho 'Hotstix' Mabuse hits with a slice of South African jazz dance. From there we move through to the more electronic kwaito and bubblegum styles, with classics like 'Peacock', 'Love Games' and 'Lets Groove Tonight!’.
